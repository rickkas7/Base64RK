\doxysection*{API}

\doxysubsection*{encode}

Encode binary data to \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ bool\ encode(const\ uint8\_t\ *src,\ size\_t\ srcLen,\ char\ *dst,\ size\_t\ \&dstLen,\ bool\ nullTerminate,\ int\ lineBreakAt\ =\ -\/1);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src Pointer to the binary data to encode.
\item src\+Len Length of the binary data to encode in bytes.
\item dst Pointer to the buffer to hold the character string. See get\+Encoded\+Size() for information on how large of a buffer you need.
\item dst\+Len On input, the length of the buffer pointed to by dst. On successful return, the number of bytes of text data.
\item null\+Terminate true to add a null terminator, false to not. Note that the length in dst\+Len does NOT include the null terminator if included.
\item line\+Break\+At Pass -\/1 to not add line breaks, or the column to add line breaks, which must be a multiple of 4 and is typically 76, sometimes 64. Default is to not add line breaks.
\item Returns true on success or false on failure (buffer too small, for example)
\end{DoxyItemize}

This method does not break the data into lines. The intended use case of this is things like Particle.\+publish and the line breaks are not helpful and just use up extra bytes.

This method does not allocate memory. It is MT safe.

\doxysubsection*{get\+Encoded\+Size}

Determine the buffer size for the encoded \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} data


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ size\_t\ getEncodedSize(size\_t\ srcLen,\ bool\ nullTerminate,\ int\ lineBreakAt\ =\ -\/1);}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src\+Len The size of the data in bytes
\item null\+Terminate true if you will be adding a null terminator or false if not
\item line\+Break\+At Pass -\/1 to not add line breaks, or the column to add line breaks, which must be a multiple of 4 and is typically 76, sometimes 64. Default is to not add line breaks.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The size is (src\+Len + 2) / 3 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 4.

This method does not allocate memory. It is MT safe.

\doxysubsection*{encode\+To\+String}

Encode binary data and return it as a String object.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ String\ encodeToString(const\ uint8\_t\ *src,\ size\_t\ srcLen,\ int\ lineBreakAt\ =\ -\/1);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src Pointer to the binary data to encode.
\item src\+Len Length of the binary data to encode in bytes.
\item line\+Break\+At Pass -\/1 to not add line breaks, or the column to add line breaks, which must be a multiple of 4 and is typically 76, sometimes 64. Default is to not add line breaks.
\item Returns A String object containing \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} data
\end{DoxyItemize}

This method does not break the data into lines. The intended use case of this is things like Particle.\+publish and the line breaks are not helpful and just use up extra bytes.

This is relatively efficient (the buffer is only allocated once using reserve) but using the other encode() method does not require a memory allocation and is more efficient.

This method is MT safe.

 \doxysubsection*{encode\+To\+String}

Encode binary data and store the data in a String object.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ void\ encodeToString(const\ uint8\_t\ *src,\ size\_t\ srcLen,\ String\ \&output);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src Pointer to the binary data to encode.
\item src\+Len Length of the binary data to encode in bytes.
\item output Filled in with the \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} encoded data
\end{DoxyItemize}

This method does not break the data into lines. The intended use case of this is things like Particle.\+publish and the line breaks are not helpful and just use up extra bytes.

This is relatively efficient (the buffer is only allocated once using reserve) but using the other encode() method does not require a memory allocation and is more efficient.

This method is MT safe. Added in version 0.\+0.\+2.

\doxysubsection*{decode (c-\/string)}

Decode \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} encoded data back to binary data from a c-\/string


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ bool\ decode(const\ char\ *src,\ uint8\_t\ *dst,\ size\_t\ \&dstLen);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src Pointer to the source string. You can directly pass a String object if desired.
\item dst Pointer to a buffer to store te binary data in
\item dst\+Len On input, the size of the buffer pointed to by dst. On successful return, the number of actual bytes.
\item Returns true on a successful decode or false on error (invalid input or dst\+Len too small)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The input src must not contain line breaks (CRLF). The intended use case of this is things like Particle.\+publish and the line breaks are not helpful and just use up extra bytes.

This method does not allocate memory. It is MT safe.

\doxysubsection*{decode (buffer and length)}

Decode \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} encoded data back to binary data from a buffer and length


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ bool\ decode(const\ char\ *src,\ size\_t\ srcLen,\ uint8\_t\ *dst,\ size\_t\ \&dstLen);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item src Pointer to the source string. It does not need to be null terminated.
\item src\+Len The length of the source string in bytes
\item dst Pointer to a buffer to store te binary data in
\item dst\+Len On input, the size of the buffer pointed to by dst. On successful return, the number of actual bytes.
\item Returns true on a successful decode or false on error (invalid input or dst\+Len too small)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The input src must not contain line breaks (CRLF). The intended use case of this is things like Particle.\+publish and the line breaks are not helpful and just use up extra bytes.

This method does not allocate memory. It is MT safe.

\doxysubsection*{get\+Max\+Decoded\+Size}

Get the maximum size of the decoded data, given \doxylink{class_base64}{Base64} encoded string of src\+Len


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{static\ size\_t\ getMaxDecodedSize(size\_t\ srcLen);}

\end{DoxyCode}


This is ((src\+Len + 3) / 4) \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} 3. The actual data may be smaller than this if it\textquotesingle{}s not a multiple of 3 bytes and padding is inserted. The actual length will be returned in dst\+Len for decode.

This method does not allocate memory. It is MT safe.

\doxysection*{Examples}

\doxysubsection*{examples/1-\/tester-\/\+Base64}

This example uses Particle functions and publish to test the various methods.

For example, given the code running on device test2\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{particle\ call\ test2\ text\ "{}hello\ world"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}


The following will appear on debug serial and published\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{text-\/>base64\ aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can then decode this to hex\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{particle\ call\ test2\ base64\ aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=}

\end{DoxyCode}


which generates\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{base64-\/>hex\ 68656c6c6f20776f726c64}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can also convert hex back to base64\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{particle\ call\ test2\ hex\ "{}68656c6c6f20776f726c64"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{hex-\/>base64\ aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsection*{examples/2-\/unittest-\/\+Base64}

This example runs pre-\/generated sample data through the parser and decoder to make sure they work properly.

\doxysection*{Test Code}

There is also code in the test directory, for off-\/device testing.

\doxysubsection*{generate-\/test-\/data}

This is the node.\+js tool that generated the test data used in the unit tests (both on-\/device and off-\/device).

\doxysubsection*{unit-\/test}

The unit-\/test is designed to run on a standard gcc environment, such as Mac or Linux, or cygwin. It encodes and decodes a variety of data samples and makes sure they match the expected data.

Data from size 0 to 16 bytes is tested, as well as other sizes up to 512 bytes, to make sure a variety of padding circumstances are tested, as well as a large number of bit combinations.

Particularly useful is running under Linux with \href{http://valgrind.org/}{\texttt{ valgrind}} installed. The {\ttfamily make check} target runs the unit-\/test program under valgrind. The tool detects common memory errors including if the code\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Accesses memory it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t (areas not yet allocated, areas that have been freed, areas past the end of heap blocks, inaccessible areas of the stack).
\item Uses uninitialized values in dangerous ways.
\item Leaks memory.
\item Does bad frees of heap blocks (double frees, mismatched frees).
\item Passes overlapping source and destination memory blocks to memcpy() and related functions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Version history}

\doxysubsection*{0.\+0.\+2 (2024-\/03-\/29)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added an encode\+To\+String overload that encodes to a String object instead of returning it.
\item Added support for adding line breaks when decoding and supporting them when decoding.
